# dockscreen

A drop-in for `docker`. `dockscreen compose` refuses compose projects that would reach outside the project directory or run with privileges, and `dockscreen run` refuses images that would. It also adds `cap_drop: [ALL]` and `no-new-privileges` to what it lets through. Everything else goes to the real docker unchanged.

It protects you from what you download, the compose project and its images. It does not protect you from your own command line. For how it works and why, see [docs/design.md](docs/design.md).

    pip install -e '.[dev]'
    dockscreen compose up -d
    pytest

## What gets refused

For `dockscreen compose`: `up`, `create`, `run`, `watch`, `scale` and `alpha` refuse a project that:

- mounts or reads files outside the project directory, or outside the configured `mount_dirs`;
- runs as a user the project may not choose (see [Users](#users));
- asks for privileges: `privileged`, `cap_add`, devices, host namespaces;
- uses volumes or networks that are external or belong to another project;
- uses a compose key that dockscreen doesn't know yet. The policy is an allowlist.

`build` and `bake` only check what building can reach: no SSH agent, no host network or privileged builds, and contexts and secrets inside the project.

Every command dockscreen screens ends its output with the verdict, right before docker or compose takes over: ✔ audit passed, ⊖ denied by audit, or ✘ audit failed when it could not look (the image did not pull, the config did not parse). If `up` or `run` does not show that line, dockscreen was not in the path. Commands it passes on unchecked (`ps`, `logs`, `exec` …) print nothing.

Messages state the facts; with `--helpful` (or `--verbose`, or in `audit`) they continue with what you can do about it. Whatever dockscreen changes is said, with a cyan mark if it rarely matters (defaults added, names resolved to ids, images pinned) or a yellow one if it can alter how things run (an image's root user replaced by the default user, or a `cap_drop` or `security_opt` of your own extended).

When refusing, dockscreen says why. `dockscreen compose harden` prints a compose override file that fixes what can be fixed.

## Users

Containers don't run as root or as you unless you say so.

- An image that would run as root runs as nobody (the configured `default_user`) instead, with a notice. Its `HOME` is set to `/tmp` (the configured `default_home`), which nobody can write to unlike root's home, unless you or the service set a `HOME`. A user that comes from the image or the config file keeps the home docker gives it, and a `default_user` of root gets none.
- A project or an image may not pick root, an id of a local account, an id from `/etc/subuid` or `/etc/subgid`, or 65535 and 4294967295. That applies to the uid, the gid and supplementary groups.
- With host mounts (bind mounts, devices, `volumes_from`, secrets, configs), the id must be in the nobody range (65530–65534 unless configured), the default user, a user configured for the image, or you with `--allow-me`.
- To run services as yourself: `dockscreen --allow-me compose up`, with `user: "${UID}:${GID}"` on those services. dockscreen sets `UID` and `GID` to your real ids.
- To give an image a user of its own, such as mariadb's 999, set `user` in its section of the config file, `[images."mariadb"]`. A service of that image may then also name 999 in `user:` itself, with mounts too. A `user` at the top level of the config file does the same for every service of every project: with your own ids there, that is `--allow-me` everywhere.
- Names in `user:` and `--as` are resolved on this host, not in the image. A name unknown here is refused, and so is a uid without a group.

The full rules are in [docs/design.md](docs/design.md#users-and-groups).

## Services without `user:`

Before starting anything, dockscreen pulls or builds each image as `up` would, and decides its user as described under [Users](#users).

An accepted image user is passed on as numbers (`user: "uid:gid"`, `docker run --user uid:gid`), never as the image's name for it. The runtime then reads nothing from the image's `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/group`, so a difference between how dockscreen and docker parse those files cannot give the container another identity. The price: the image's supplementary groups are not applied.

A service whose image was looked at also gets `pull_policy: never` and, unless it is built from a Dockerfile, `image:` set to the checked image's id, in the generated file only. Something else retagging the image between the check and the run cannot change what starts. `docker compose ps` therefore shows the id instead of the name.

Compose interpolates the files it reads, so the generated file is written as `docker compose config` printed it (a literal `$` is `$$`, which reads back as a literal `$`). Before anything is pulled or built, dockscreen asks compose for the config of that file and refuses unless it equals the config that was checked.

## Variables from your shell

`environment: [FOO]` takes FOO from your shell. dockscreen does not refuse it, but `audit` and every run that starts containers say which services get which variables (names only, never values). The resolved config does not record where a value came from, so a pass-through is recognised by the value being your shell's own under the same name: `X: ${FOO}` is not noticed, and `FOO: bar` is reported if your shell has `FOO=bar`. `UID` and `GID` are left out.

## Network

dockscreen does not filter the network: a container can reach the internet, and with Docker's defaults also the host
and the local network. Code running in the container should not be trusted, and neither should a local network
(a hotel, a train, a conference), so on a host with rootful Docker and UFW, install
[docker-fw](https://github.com/brightbyte/docker-fw). Its rules keep containers from reaching the host and the
private address ranges of the LAN, stop Docker from bypassing UFW for published ports, and still let containers
use DNS, talk to each other and reach the public internet. 

The restrictions imposed by docker-fw can be bypassed using `--network host`, or by adding an appropriate `ufw` rule.

## Commands

| Command | |
|---|---|
| `dockscreen compose audit [--brief]` | run the checks and report, without starting anything (it pulls and builds) |
| `dockscreen compose harden` (also `fix`) | print a compose override that fixes what can be fixed; the rest is listed as comments |
| `dockscreen compose doctor` | show the compose version in use |
| `dockscreen audit [--brief] [run options] IMAGE [COMMAND]` | say what `dockscreen run` would do with the same arguments, without starting anything (see [Images](#images)) |

## Configuration

dockscreen reads `/etc/dockscreen/config.toml` and then `~/.config/dockscreen/config.toml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dockscreen/config.toml`), which overrides it key by key. If your file doesn't exist, dockscreen creates it with every setting commented out, showing the defaults. Environment variables and the project's `.env` do not configure it. Whatever the files say is trusted, so they are only read if the file and every directory above it are owned by you or root and writable by nobody else; otherwise dockscreen refuses to run. Unknown keys are an error.

```toml
default_user = "65534:65534"       # replaces an image's root user
default_home = "/tmp"             # its HOME; "" leaves HOME alone
nobody_range = [65530, 65534]      # ids any project or image may use, mounts or not
mount_dirs = ["/srv/shared-data"]  # where bind mounts may come from, besides the project
security_opts = []                 # security options allowed besides no-new-privileges
user = "1000:1000"                 # the user every image runs as, unless the service or you choose one
docker = "/usr/bin/docker"         # the real docker, if not the next one on PATH

[images."mariadb"]                 # for every image pulled from this repository
user = "999:999"

[projects."/home/me/src/shop"]     # for this project directory and everything below it
mount_dirs = ["/srv/shop-uploads"]
```

Every setting except `docker` can also go in an image section and a project section. They apply in that order, after the top level: a single value (`user`, `default_user`, `default_home`, `nobody_range`) replaces the one before, a list (`mount_dirs`, `security_opts`) is added to. Nothing stops a section from allowing too much: that is your call.

When dockscreen refuses something the config file could allow (a bind mount outside the project, an image's own user), the message names the setting and your config file.

An image section names a repository, without tag: it trusts the image's maintainer. It applies only to an image that docker records as pulled from that repository, and never to a service that builds its image, because anything can be tagged locally under any name. Before an image is pulled, its name is enough to pass the first checks; the check right before the run needs the proof, and refuses a service that only passed because of a section its image does not have.

A `mount_dirs` entry that contains your home directory, a system directory, the config file or the docker socket gets a warning on every run. A project directory that contains one of them is refused, and the search for a compose file stops at your home directory and at the first directory that is not yours.

## Options

Before the subcommand, such as `dockscreen --allow-me compose up` or `dockscreen --allow-me run IMAGE`:

| Option | |
|---|---|
| `--allow-me` | containers may run as you: in `user:`, and as an image's own user |
| `--helpful`, `--verbose` | add to each message what to do about it. The `audit` commands do this anyway. `--verbose` is taken by dockscreen, not passed on, so docker and compose stay quiet |
| `--strict-screen` | `audit` only so far: also fail for what the command line asks for that a project or image may not have; refused before any other subcommand |
| `--skip-screening` | turns off all checks and defaults, and prints a warning each time |

After `run` or `exec` (compose or docker, and `create` and `audit`), before the service, image or container:

| Option | |
|---|---|
| `--user UID:GID` / `-u UID:GID` | numeric ids only |
| `--as NAME` | a local user, resolved on this host |
| `--as-me` | yourself; for `run` and `audit` (not compose), also `--allow-me` |

`up` takes none of these; `--as-me` before the subcommand is refused.

## Images

- `dockscreen run` checks the image's user like this:
  - the container is created, checked, then started;
  - an image that would run as root runs as the default user unless you choose a user;
  - an image user that the [rules](#users) refuse, with the container's mounts, is refused;
  - a user the config file sets for the image's repository is used, as for compose;
  - an accepted image user is passed to docker as `--user uid:gid` (the container is created a second time with it).
- `start` and `restart` refuse existing containers that would fail that check.
- `create` gets the hardening defaults.
- Remote daemons are refused, here and for `dockscreen compose`.

Choosing a user (see [Options](#options)) skips the image check. `--allow-me` also works before the image name.

`dockscreen audit` takes the arguments of `dockscreen run` and says what `run` would do with them, without starting anything. It creates the container as `run` would, pulling the image if `run` would, judges the image's user with the mounts you gave, and removes the container. It exits with 1 if `run` would refuse.

It also points out what the command line asks for that a compose project or an image may not have: `--privileged`, `--cap-add`, devices, host namespaces, `--security-opt` other than no-new-privileges, bind mounts outside the current directory and the configured `mount_dirs`, and a `--user` that the [rules](#users) would refuse from an image. `run` allows these, because the command line is trusted. `dockscreen --strict-screen audit …` fails the audit for them too: without it, the audit answers "will it run", with it "is it safe".

### Audit results

Both audits, `dockscreen audit` and `dockscreen compose audit`, end with one of three verdicts, which is also the exit status:

| Exit status | Verdict | |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | passed | it would run (with `--strict-screen`: and the command line asks for nothing a project could not) |
| 1 | refused | the policy says no |
| 3 | failed | the audit could not get far enough to judge: no docker, the image could not be pulled or created, the compose config could not be read, a pull or build failed |

Exit status 2 means the audit was called wrongly. The report ends with the verdict: ✔ audit passed, ⊖ denied by audit or ✘ audit failed. Each item in the report starts with a dot, ●, green when accepted as it is, yellow when allowed but changed by dockscreen or worth a look, red when refused or not checked; ⓘ marks a hint. The colours come from the terminal, as in docker's own output, so they show in any font; piped output and `NO_COLOR` get the symbols without colour.

`--brief` prints only the verdict, in one line, such as `✔ audit passed` or `⊖ denied by audit: privileged is not allowed (+2 more)`. Output from docker itself, such as pull progress, still appears.

Images that start as root and drop privileges themselves, such as postgres or redis, usually need `--user`, `user:` or a `user` in their image section of the config file.

## Wrapping `docker`

To screen every `docker` command you type, put `bin/docker`, or a symlink named `docker` to `dockscreen`, ahead of the real docker on your `PATH`. dockscreen skips itself when it looks for the real docker.

Only commands that go through the wrapper are checked. Scripts, IDEs and anything else that talks to the docker socket directly bypass it.

### Tools that need the real docker

Some tools run containers that are meant to be privileged or to run as root, and dockscreen refuses to start them. minikube's docker driver is one: its node container runs systemd as root with `--privileged`, so `docker start minikube` ends in `cannot change the user of an existing container`, and recreating it as a non-root user would break it. Docker cannot change the user of an existing container, so there is nothing for dockscreen to adjust.

Give such a tool the real docker, for that command only, by putting the directory of the real docker ahead of dockscreen's on its `PATH`:

```sh
PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH minikube start      # if /usr/bin/docker is the real docker
```

or wrap it once, in a function or a script that is not on your `PATH` as `docker`:

```sh
minikube() { PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH command minikube "$@"; }
```

A config entry that skips screening for an image or a container name is deliberately not offered: it would stay in effect unnoticed, and a compose project can choose its image and container names. Use `--skip-screening` before the subcommand for a single command you type yourself.
