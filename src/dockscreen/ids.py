"""Numeric uids and gids, and the uid and gid compose files see.

dockscreen exports UID and GID, the real ids of the caller, for compose files to interpolate
(`user: "${UID}:${GID}"`); values already in the environment are overwritten. Running as these ids is
not allowed unless --allow-me is given (see idrules): exporting them only makes the project's intent
readable.

Ids given by the command line, the config file or the project are ASCII digits only. How docker reads
ids out of an image's passwd and group files is different, and lives in imageuser.
