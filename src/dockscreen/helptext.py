"""Help for dockscreen and the commands it audits or adds, laid out like docker's own.

An overview lists dockscreen's options and the commands it audits or adds; a topic covers one command.
Docker's (or compose's) own help for the same thing follows ours, except for commands only dockscreen
has. Text is wrapped as the audit report is (messages.report_width): option and command descriptions
under their own column, as docker does.
