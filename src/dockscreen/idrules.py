"""Which uids and gids a project or an image may choose for a container.

Applies to every id that comes from an untrusted source: `user:` and hook users in a compose
file, and the user an image runs as. Ids from the command line and the config file are trusted and are
not checked here.

Never accepted, unless they are allowed ids (below):
- 0, root;
- an id that exists on this host: the container would share that account's kernel limits
  (processes, inotify watches), and own its files in anything it mounts;
- an id in a subordinate range (/etc/subuid, /etc/subgid, any owner): files with these ids belong to
  rootless containers on this host;
- 65535 and 4294967295, which tools read as "no id";
- an id above 2147483647, which docker refuses and older daemons wrap or clamp.

With host mounts (bind mounts, devices, volumes_from, secrets, configs) the id must be an allowed id,
because what the container can write on the host depends on it.

Allowed ids: the nobody range and the default user from the config file, ids the caller adds for one
check (a configured image user), and the caller's own ids when --allow-me was given.
