"""Deciding the user a container runs as when the command line or the service does not choose one.

The image is hostile: its own /etc/passwd and /etc/group decide the identity docker would use (see
imageuser), and the id rules decide whether the image may have it (idrules). With no user chosen, in
this order:
- the config file names a user for the image's repository, and the image was pulled from there:
  that user, whatever it is (images.section_for, config.effective);
- the image would run as root (uid, gid or a supplementary gid of 0): the configured default user
  instead, nobody unless configured otherwise, with a notice;
- otherwise the image's own user, if the id rules accept it; refused if not.

Whatever is accepted is not left for the runtime to resolve a second time: it runs as `uid:gid`, the
checked numbers (pinned_user), so a difference between our reading of the image's passwd and group
files and the runtime's can at worst refuse a good image, never run root.

Used by `docker run` (gate) and by compose (composeimages) alike.
