"""Which environment variables of the shell end up in which service.

`environment: [FOO]` takes FOO from the shell. The resolved config shows it like any other value, so a
pass-through is recognised by the value being the shell's own under the same name. That also catches
`FOO: bar` when the shell happens to have FOO=bar, and misses `X: ${FOO}`, which copies the value under
another name. The variables dockscreen exports for compose files are left out. Values are never shown.
