"""The images of services that set no `user`: get them as compose would, then decide as `docker run` does.

A project file is hostile, so a service without `user:` cannot just be assumed to run as root or as
whatever its image says. The image is acquired first, following the project's own pull policy so that
automatic updates keep happening (pull, or build if it is built from a Dockerfile), and then the same
rule as `docker run` is applied to the identity it would run as (imagedecision.assess):

- the config file names a user for the image's repository, and the image was pulled from there:
  that user;
- root: the configured default user instead (nobody unless configured otherwise), with a notice;
- otherwise the image's own user if the id rules accept it, with the service's mounts; refused if not.

Whatever is accepted is pinned in the generated config as `user: "uid:gid"`.

In the generated config only, services that were looked at get `pull_policy: never` and, unless they are
built, `image:` set to the id of the image that was checked, so that compose runs that image and neither
pulls another one nor follows a tag that something else has moved in between. Neither is written to the files
the project owns or to `harden` output, which would silently turn off the project's updates.

A service that is not started by this command and sets no user is run as the default user if it does get
started: a mistake in working out what starts must fail safe. So is a service whose user the command line
chose (`run -u`), which the command line then overrides.
