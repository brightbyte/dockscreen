"""dockscreen's own options, which docker and compose never see.

Before the subcommand (strip() takes them out):
- --skip-screening runs the real thing with no checks and no defaults. After the subcommand it is
  not recognised, so docker or compose rejects it, which is the safe direction. The warning is
  printed every time and cannot be silenced, because the flag may have been copied into a script or
  an alias.
- --allow-me lets services and images run as the caller's own ids (see idrules).
- --helpful (or --verbose) adds the second part of messages that have one: why, and what it costs.
  The audit commands do that anyway. --verbose is taken here, not passed on, so that it does not
  make docker or compose noisy as well.
- --strict-screen treats the command line as untrusted too: what it asks for that a project or an
  image may not have (see runpolicy) is refused. Only `audit` supports it so far; everything else
  refuses to run with it, rather than ignore it.

After `audit`, for compose and docker alike: --brief prints only the verdict, in one line.

After `run` or `exec` (composeargs and runargs replace them by `--user=uid:gid`):
- --as NAME: a local user by name, resolved on this host.
- --as-me: the caller's own ids; with `docker run` it implies --allow-me.
