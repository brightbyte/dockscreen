An image section names a repository: it trusts the image's maintainer, not one image. A name alone
proves nothing, because anything can be built or tagged locally under any name, so an image matches only
if docker recorded that it was pulled from that repository (a repo digest), and never for a service that
is built from a Dockerfile.
