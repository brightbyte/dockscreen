"""The outcome of an audit, which is also its exit status, and of the screening before a command runs.

Refused means the policy says no. Failed means the audit could not get far enough to judge: docker,
the image or the compose config was not there, or pulling or building failed. A refusal is about the
project, image or command line; a failure is about getting to them, and may go away when retried.
Exit status 2 is left for usage errors.
