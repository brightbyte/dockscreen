"""Running docker compose from the config we checked, not from the files it would find itself.

The resolved config is hardened, checked, written to a private temporary file
(`config` prints a literal `$` as `$$`, so compose reads the file back to the same values)
and handed to compose as its only file, together with the project directory and
name it came from. What was checked is then exactly what runs: no second
reading of the project's files, no discovery rules to mirror. composeimages.prepare
asks compose for the config of the generated file and refuses if it differs from
what was checked. The price is that
compose runs as a child process (so the file can be removed afterwards) and
shows the temporary file as its config file.
